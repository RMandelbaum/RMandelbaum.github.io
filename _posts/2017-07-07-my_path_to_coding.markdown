People keep asking me why I got into coding, with the hopes of hearing my one 'aha!' moment, but like most things I do, I kind of just went with a gut feeling. 

My first attempt at coding happened in college, when I decided to study computer science, and enrolled in a C++ course. I went in expecting to learn how to hack an entire system within three months, and to my total shock all I did was spend the entire semester struggling to code a diamond made out of asteriks. I quickly changed majors. 

I graduated college, traveled a bit, and came to realize that I still had no clue what I wanted to do with my career. I was having fun doing the NYC hustle by working several part-time jobs, but I was ready for a career. Something was still nagging me to give coding another shot.

I signed up for a front-end course at NYU School of Professional Studies, and it was nothing like the course I took while in college. I loved it! So here I am, after months of research and long email exchanges with software developers, at the Flatiron School enrolled in the fullstack web development program. I continue to ask myself why I'm coding, and I still don't know one specific reason, but there's something here that just feels right.
