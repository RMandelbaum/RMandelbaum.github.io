We all know that Rails has many tools to offer when building a web application, so much that we mistake it for magic. This being said, starting my Rails portfolio project, left me feeling somewhat like a lost wizard. But, that is why I love project mode. It’s the perfect opportunity to connect the dots, and fill in the knowledge gaps. The only way to really learn to code, is to code, so I was excited to build a Rails application. 

For my project, I wanted to build something practical and of personal interest, so I decided to build a dog walking application, called DogGo. This app would allow for two different types of users, a dog walker and an administrator. The user experience would be as follows: 


**Dog Walker**
1. Sign Up/Login with email or Facebook.
2. Create a profile with a bio and two references.
3. View a list of dogs and view an individual dog’s profile page, listing details pertaining to breed, age, and temperament.
4. View all the available walk time slots,  and reserve that walk time. If they couldn’t do the walk anymore, the user has the option to cancel the walk. 
5. View all their upcoming walks, and also view a page that listed dog walks that were still available and urgent. 

**Administrator** 
1. View all the dog walkers, listing names and emails.
2. View all the dogs and their individual profile page. 
2. Add a new walk to the dog’s profile page.
3. View all the walks that are reserved, listing the associated dog name, walker’s name, and time of walk.

Each item listed above allowed me to utilize different aspects of RoR. I learned a great deal on nesting and nested attributes, validations, user authentication, and omniauth, to name a few. I'm excited to learn more to build on top of this application, and be able to add new features in the upcoming weeks.
