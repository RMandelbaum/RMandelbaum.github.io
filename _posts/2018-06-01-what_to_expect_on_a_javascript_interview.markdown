While prepping for interviews, I asked a friend who interviews candidates quite often and he gave me some great advice on how to prepare for whiteboarding. 
> 
> For whiteboarding I would guess that they’ll probably ask you typical algorithmic / data structures questions. There are a few key things that are good to keep in mind when white boarding... One thing is to practice whiteboarding with a real board, or as close as you can get, so you get used to using all the space on the board. You can and should take up the whole board if you need to. The board is your domain. And there are some steps you can take to make sure you show them you know what you’re doing. If you repeat / practice the same steps at home, then it will come more naturally during the interview. 
> 
> So when the interviewer asks you the question, you should first do a few things:
> 1.  After the interviewer asks, write down what you know about the problem. You want to write down what you know and what you don’t so you can refer to this throughout the course of the question. You also want to clarify any points here with the interviewer, like what are the possible inputs, what is the expected output, and are there any edge cases (e.g. null, 0, infinity, etc). This shows the interviewer that you are diligent and that you think of these types of things. 
> 
 >2. After clarifying details, you want to think about an approach. First you want to think about the most naive solution to the problem. And in that case you should clarify to the interviewer that there may be a more efficient solution, but that this would at least solve the problem. You could write out your thoughts on the board in pseudocode, meaning that you show your logic, but not the specific details of the code necessarily unless asked for.  If you get here and you have absolutely no idea what to say or do, don’t worry too much and keep clarifying details from the interviewer to jog your mind or give yourself time. Keep writing down what you know and then try to apply as naive a solution as possible.

>3. If you’ve developed a naive solution, try to optimize upon the solution or mention other ways that it could be solved. Also, double check your answer to make sure that you didn’t miss any edge cases clarify with the interviewer that everything looks good. 
> 
> There are a few different acronyms to help remember this type of stuff. You can see some articles about this [here](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/before-you-code-remember-to-prep-for-your-coding-interview-2ccfb58147db) 
> 
> *General Tips:*
> 
> * Always keep talking. The interviewer isn’t in your head and you want to make sure that they understand your thought process. The most important thing often isn’t that you get the question right, but that you show how you are thinking and how you would approach this type of problem. 
> 
 >* Remember to talk to the interviewer and not just the board. It’s ok to talk as you’re writing, but remember to look back every now and then and make eye contact / show that you are engaged. 
 >
 >* It’s natural to not know the answer to something right away, in fact it’s extremely rare. You should try to think of similar problems and speak out loud about your ideas for how you might approach the problem. You can always say something like, “so in this situation I might do something like X, but actually I don’t think that would work because of Y” - this also shows your thought process and helps you figure your way through the problem while the interviewer is there.
 > 
 >*  You can ask the interviewer questions. Sometimes they are willing to give you tips, answer unknowns, and sometimes even tell you how to solve something if you ask enough. 
 >
 >*  It’s good to know about, and mention, the time complexity (big O) of a problem. You should learn about what types of operations cause different time complexities as well. 
 >
 >*  It’s really good to practice with real live people if possible. Find a coder friend or just a friend to ask you questions and practice on a whiteboard if you can find one. 
 >
 >* Practice a bunch of different types of algorithm / data structures problems. [Interview Cake](http://www.interviewcake.com) is a great resource because it walks you through things, though it’s slightly expensive. I got a membership to it when I was interviewing though, and it was very helpful. There are plenty of other sites out there for practicing interview questions as well.
