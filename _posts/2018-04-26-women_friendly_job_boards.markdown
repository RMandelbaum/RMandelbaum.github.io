It’s pretty overwhelming searching for that first job as a developer, so I wanted to share some women friendly job boards that I’ve been using. I’ve met quite a handful of lovely ladies who have been super helpful in my search, and I love the female comradery that is growing with the tech industry.

Before I list some resources, make sure to check out the [Women Take Tech Scholarship](http://go.flatironschool.com/women-take-tech). They give up to 50% off and have made my coding education way more affordable. 

Alright, then let’s get to it. Here’s a few forums/job boards to join to harness the female power! 

[Hire Tech Ladies]( https://www.hiretechladies.com/)

A community of ladies that connect you to jobs in tech. There's a job drop every week and you can apply through them and increase your chance of being seen by a hiring manager. They also hold events and conferences, and are great with finding new and current jobs. 

[Power To Fly](http://powertofly.com)

A recruitment site that connects ladies in tech. They stress mentorship connections, diversity, events, in addition to job listings. 

[Women 2.0](http://www.women2.com/about-lane/) 

There's a specific chapter called Lane that is dedicated to finding women roles in high tech companies. They have job listings, events, and are creating a global brand of women in tech start ups. 

[Women Who Code](http://www.womenwhocode.com/) 

A non profit that strives to motivate women to join the tech industry. They have a great resource for jobs, events, mentorships, and just all around good vibes for getting women interested in technology. 

Hopefully you learned of new resources, and connect to your next job through one of these sites. Best of luck!
