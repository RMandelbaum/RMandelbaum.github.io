While searching for jobs, it is becoming more common for scammers to reach out to you. This can be very frustrating, because you just want that first job, and want to hope for the best, but it’s a scam. I recently was in contact with a person from a legitimate company, but there were a few red flags. So, I looked it up to see if anyone can give some advice on noticing and avoiding a fake recruiter. I found this helpful post on [flex job](http://www.flexjobs.com/blog/post/beware-increasingly-common-job-scam-using-flexjobs-name/)


**Learn to recognize some of the steps a scammer may take:**

1. The scammer reaches out over email or Facebook Messenger. They ask you to do a job interview over Google Hangouts, Facebook Messenger, or Skype (more on that later).
2. They say they’re an employer and found you via FlexJobs or that they work for FlexJobs—or other common job sites such as Indeed or ZipRecruiter. The scammers intentionally mention trusted job sites to get you to let your guard down by associating with sites you might already be using and are familiar with.
3. The scammer sometimes sends a link to the real FlexJobs BBB rating site and/or to our homepage to verify that they are “not a scam.” But anyone can send a link to pages such as those–this is not proof that something is not a scam!
4. The scammer’s email address is a generic email such as “fakename@gmail.com,” rather than using an email associated with the company they claim to be representing, such as “realname@company.com.” Keep in mind that sometimes the company they say they represent is entirely fake, and other times they will falsely say they are with a legitimate company (so if you google the company, you can find the company and it appears more likely to be legitimate).
5. They ask you to interview on Google Hangouts, Facebook Messenger, or Skype. This is a red flag because most legitimate employers will use a regular phone call, a personalized recruiting platform, an internal video/phone conference system, or similar. Scammers like Google Hangouts and Facebook Messenger because it is very easy to set up fake accounts that are not traceable.
6. BIGGEST RED FLAG: During the interview, the scammer asks you for personal information, such as your name and address or specific banking information (username and password for online banking) or an address to to send checks to.
7. They may claim they need this information so you can make an upfront payment for the job, often for “supplies” or a “computer preloaded with proprietary software,” promising reimbursement in your first paycheck. Any request for payment as part of the job interview process is always an immediate red flag!
8. Scammers often use oddly formal wording and/or poor grammar, spelling, and punctuation. A large percentage of these scams originate from outside of the U.S., so the English can often be unprofessional. Typically, any legitimate employer will aim to be professional and have well-edited communications with candidates, so while typos or poor grammar can happen to the best of us, it shouldn’t be pervasive.

**What To Do If You’ve Spotted This Scam**

Follow these steps to report the scammer to each platform where you’ve interacted with them:

* Report them as fraud to Facebook.
* Block them on Facebook Messenger.
* Remove them from any other location where you may have them as a contact (like Gmail or Google Hangouts) and report them as fraud on those platforms.
* If the scammer offers to send you an iTunes gift card as a form of payment (which is common), report it to Apple.
* It is deeply important to us to protect our users from job scams, and we hope you don’t mind us taking this extra step to alert you of this potential one.

Hopefully, you catch these scammers before they catch you!
