The moment I started coding, was the moment I realized I've been learning the wrong way my entire life. Teachers have always made me believe that I must memorize and perfect the material in order to move on, or else I'll fall behind. All this really taught me was anxiety and a whole lot of self doubt. Not the best learning tactic. 

That's why I love coding. It's changed my understanding of how to learn. There are times where I want to give up and walk away from my computer forever, but I keep reminding myself to take a deep breath and that it is okay to not fully understand the lesson. Keep pushing forward, and it will eventually click. It is possible to move forward without perfecting the material, and still be learning.  

Coding has also taught me that failing means learning. As we all know, in order to pass a test, we must go through a lot of daunting error messages, but that's the only way to learn how to fix your code. There was one particular lab that began with over 30 failed tests, and I picked away at them one by one until they all passed. The old me would have given up, but now I see these errors as clues to learn how my code works. Finally, failing is a positive thing!
